# 🚀 Hugos - AI Interview Platform

> **Hugos is a custom-built AI interview platform** I developed using Next.js and HuggingFace, featuring **local voice processing** (no third-party APIs) and a **privacy-focused architecture**. While inspired by AI interview concepts, the implementation is **100% original code** with legally sourced assets.

A **100% custom-built** AI interview platform featuring:
- 🎤 **Local voice processing** (no Vapi/third-party APIs)
- 🧠 **HuggingFace AI integration** (no Google Gemini)
- 🔒 **Privacy-focused architecture**
- 💰 **Cost-effective solution** - **Up to 90% cheaper** than alternatives (no per-minute fees)
- 🛠️ **Original codebase** (not a clone)

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Feature | Traditional Solutions | Hugos | Savings |
|---------|---------------------|-------|---------|
| Voice API | $0.004-0.016/min | **FREE** (Web Speech API) | 100% |
| AI Processing | $0.50-2.00/hr | ~.05-0.20/hr (HuggingFace) | Up to 90% |
| Platform Fees | $49-299/month | **FREE** (self-hosted) | 100% |
| **Total Cost/Interview** | **$2-10** | **$0.10-0.50** | **Up to 95%** |

**Why it's cheaper:** By using browser-native voice processing and direct HuggingFace API calls, we eliminate expensive third-party voice APIs (like Vapi, Twilio) and premium AI services (like OpenAI, Gemini).
